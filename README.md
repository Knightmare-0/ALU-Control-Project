### Tasks
+ Complete the testbench to verify all the operations in individual cores
+ Make a 2-bit flag output that tells which core is being used in the top module
+ Show the flag output as a signal in the testbench to verify
+ Synthesize the top module with the library sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib from yosys
+ Run Static Timing Analysis using OpenSTA
+ Document the output of the testbench in the simulation folder
+ Document the STA Analysis in the same folder and determine the Clock Frequency
+ Edit all the script files with proper paths and file names
+ Update the readme file in the synthesis folder - paste the ss of synthesis output for both modules
+ also attach the different gates used
